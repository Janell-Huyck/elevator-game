## My solutions to play.elevatorsaga.com

play.elevatorsaga.com is an online coding game where you are writing the code to
make an elevator or elevators operate correctly.  The object is to move a certain 
number of passengers within a set time limit.  Each level is progressively more 
difficult and complex.  

I was introduced to play.elevatorsaga.com by a friend.  We started working 
together on solutions, and then split off into doing separate solutions.  
This repo was created to keep track of mine.

Because of the setup of the game, all the code needs to be in one file.  The 
"init" and "update" are there because of how the game is set up.

This file will not run on its own.  It's not supposed to.  If you want to
see it in action, copy and paste the entire thing into the website
play.elevatorsaga.com and then click "Apply".

Each level in the game is a bit harder than the last.  As of Jul 13, 2021, I am 
working on getting my code working for level 4.
